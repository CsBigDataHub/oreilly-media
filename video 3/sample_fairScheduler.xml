                The allocation file configures minimum shares, running job limits, weights and preemption timeouts for each pool.
                Only users/pools whose values differ from the defaults need to be explicitly configured in this file.
                The allocation file is located in HADOOP_HOME/conf/fair-scheduler.xml. It can contain the following types of elements:

                pool elements, which configure each pool. These may contain the following sub-elements:
                minMaps and minReduces, to set the pool's minimum share of task slots.
                maxMaps and maxReduces, to set the pool's maximum concurrent task slots.
                schedulingMode, the pool's internal scheduling mode, which can be fair for fair sharing or fifo for first-in-first-out.
                maxRunningJobs, to limit the number of jobs from the pool to run at once (defaults to infinite).
                weight, to share the cluster non-proportionally with other pools. For example, a pool with weight 2.0 will get a 2x
                higher share than other pools. The default weight is 1.0.
                minSharePreemptionTimeout, the number of seconds the pool will wait before killing other pools' tasks if it
                is below its minimum share (defaults to infinite).
                user elements, which may contain a maxRunningJobs element to limit jobs. Note that by default, there is
                a pool for each user, so per-user limits are not necessary.
                poolMaxJobsDefault, which sets the default running job limit for any pools whose limit is not specified.
                userMaxJobsDefault, which sets the default running job limit for any users whose limit is not specified.
                defaultMinSharePreemptionTimeout, which sets the default minimum share preemption timeout for any pools
                where it is not specified.
                fairSharePreemptionTimeout, which sets the preemption timeout used when jobs are below half their fair share.
                defaultPoolSchedulingMode, which sets the default scheduling mode (fair or fifo) for pools whose mode is not specified.
                Pool and user elements only required if you are setting non-default values for the pool/user.
                That is, you do not need to declare all users and all pools in your config file before running the fair scheduler.
                If a user or pool is not listed in the config file, the default values for limits, preemption timeouts, etc will be used.
