# Setup

## Basic Spark Installation

1. Download Here: http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html.

2. Make sure you have the correct Hadoop Version that matches your 
local or cluster installation.

3. Make sure the Version of Scala is checked as well. 2.11 is
now default in Spark 2.0. Download the 2.10 separately.

## This Video Tutorial

Running on A Mac Book, I used Homebrew to install the Packages of Spark, Mesos, and Hadoop
```
brew install apache-spark
brew install mesos
brew install hadoop
```
The above will install in your `/usr/local/Cellar/` directory with their own names.

## Installations for other Operating Systems

## IDE

I prefer to use IntelliJ since it helps in getting things organized and indexed. Moreover, the scala plugin is easy to use.
Feel free to use the same or any one that you are comfortable with.
